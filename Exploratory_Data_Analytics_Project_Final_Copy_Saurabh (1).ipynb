        "\n",
        "* Pricing Optimization: Utilize the insights gained from the analysis of neighborhood, room type, and minimum nights to optimize pricing strategies. Adjust prices based on demand and customer preferences in specific neighborhoods, offering competitive rates for different stay durations. This can maximize revenue and attract the desired audience.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Targeted Marketing: Tailor marketing efforts to specific neighborhoods and stay durations. Develop targeted campaigns that highlight the unique features and advantages of accommodations in each neighborhood. Promote shorter stays in Bronx and Staten Island as budget-friendly options, while emphasizing luxury and longer stays in Manhattan and Brooklyn. This can increase customer engagement and bookings.\n",

Continuously monitor customer feedback and reviews to address any issues and ensure a positive guest experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Market Expansion: Explore growth opportunities in neighborhoods with high demand and limited supply. Identify areas where shorter stays or specific room types are in demand and consider expanding property acquisition or management in those locations. This can help tap into underserved markets and drive business growth.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Competitive Analysis: Continuously monitor competitors in the market, especially in posh areas like Manhattan and Brooklyn. Stay updated on their pricing strategies, room types offered, and customer reviews. Identify opportunities to differentiate offerings and provide unique value propositions to maintain a competitive edge.\n",
